# MAPP

MAPP is the default application view template.

This is a responsive view with a display threshold of 768px width. Depending on the width of the display the control element will either be displayed on the left hand side or as a scrollable container at the bottom of small displays.

The tabview control will not be displayed on small screens.

Login might be required for the MAPP view dependent on the PRIVATE or PUBLIC environment setting.
