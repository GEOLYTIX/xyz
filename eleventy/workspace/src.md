# Source links

Typically a ressource link is defined as a value for an entry with `src` as key.

Links allow the XYZ host to gather ressources which are required to assemble the workspace.

The XYZ Library may also fetch style ressources, images, or plugin scripts from URI references defined as `src` entries.
