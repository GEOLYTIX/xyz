# Design

XYZ application views, such as MAPP, maybe be composed with predefined control elements. These elements are defined as classes in the control.css which is hosted as a static file in the /public/css XYZ directory.

The control.css file itself is compiled from individual SCSS files in the same directory.

This section of the documentation will highlight the individual control element classes and explain how elements can be modified by overwriting component styles.

The mobile and desktop MAPP views have their own style sheets which define the layout configuration as well as overrides for components nested within the individual application view panels.

Responsive application views used for embeds and reports will be added to this section once they become publicly available.
