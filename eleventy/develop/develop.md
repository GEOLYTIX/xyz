# XYZ development

The XYZ project consists of two distinct parts.

**XYZ API**; The XYZ host is collection of programming interfaces to pass transactional script from the client library to the data source layer.

Core development contributes to the XYZ API and library code directly. In order for core developments to be implemented a pull request must be sent to the maintainers of the XYZ repository. Alternatively the XYZ repository may be forked and altered in accordance with the [XYZ licence](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/blob/master/LICENSE).

**XYZ Library**; A compiled client library for interacting with the XYZ API. The control library also provides functional control elements such as maps and graphs for application views.

**JAMStack** development is the design of application views comprised of markup and script which use the XYZ Library to connect to the XYZ API.
