# 3.4.0

## Documentation

Hidden flag in layer styles configuration

Cluster style object: 

* markerMin and markerMax replaced with "size" which is now the default size of the icon

* "marker" renamed to "default"

* "markerMulti" renamed to "cluster"

* location markers now use size (in pixels) and also can use scale which defaults to 1, 1.2 for cluster, 1.3 for highlight.

* "cluster":{} marker now inherits default styling properties and these can be overridden.

* Labelling - to add count label on clusters set count: true inside style.label.
