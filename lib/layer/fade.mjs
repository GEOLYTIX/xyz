/**
 * # layer/fade
 * 
 * The `fade()` animation function implements linear interpolation to achieve a smooth transition between opacities on a the cluster layer format. 
 * The fade will occur during the zoom in and out as well as changing the view port.
 * ### 🎯 Target Opacity Calculation: 
 * - Depending on whether fading in or out, the target opacity is calculated. 
 * - If fading out, the opacity is reduced by 20% or brought to a minimum of 0. 
 * - If fading in, the opacity is increased by 20% or limited to a maximum of 1.
 * 
 * ### ⏱️ Animation Duration and Timing: 
 * - The animation duration is set to 100 milliseconds (adjustable), and the start time of the animation is recorded.
 * ### 📊 Opacity Update Function: 
 * - The `updateOpacity` function is used to calculate the current time and elapsed time since the animation started.
 * 
 * ### 🌟 Interpolation and Opacity Update:
 * - If the elapsed time is less than the animation duration, interpolation is used to smoothly transition the opacity between `currentOpacity` and `targetOpacity`. 
 * - The `requestAnimationFrame` is used to schedule the next frame of the animation. 
 * - When the animation duration has elapsed, the layer's opacity is set to the `targetOpacity`, concluding the animation.
 * ### 🚀 Starting the Animation: 
 * - The animation is triggered by calling the `updateOpacity` function.
 * ### ⏳ Setting New Timeout:
 * - A new fade timeout is set for the next step of the fade animation after the specified duration has passed, ensuring the animation continues until the desired opacity is reached.
